INSTALLATION

PREREQUISITES
=============
* Django
* Boto

DJANGO
------
The Djurk software package is installed into Django as a Django app. This
means that you first need to have an installed version of Django running.

Follow the instructions at this website:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/install/

NOTE: The project directory that you use in the installation from the above
      instructions cannot also be called 'djurk'. Use another name, such
      as 'djurk_project' instead.


BOTO
----
You will additionally need the 'boto' library that interfaces with Django
Mechanical Turk.

This is often easily installed with either a pip or easy install command.

Here is an example install (This package was tested with boto version 2.1.1).

prompt> pip install boto==2.1.1
Downloading/unpacking boto==2.1.1

TESTING SETUP
-------------
To test the installation of your prerequisites:

STEP 1
------
Start the runserver: (i.e., ./manage.py runserver)

prompt> python manage.py runserver
Validating models...

0 errors found
Django version 1.3.1, using settings 'djurk_project.settings'
Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

STEP 2
------
Go to the Admin site:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/

If you see the message "It worked! Congratulations on your first Django-powered
page.' then you have successfully installed Django. Ctrl-C to stop the
runserver command.

STEP 3
------
Test your boto installation. Start the Django shell:

prompt> python manage.py shell
Python 2.6.1 (r261:67515, Aug  2 2010, 20:10:18) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5646)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
(InteractiveConsole)
>>> import boto
>>> 

If you saw no errors when issuing the 'import boto' command, then you have
successfully installed the boto prerequisite.


DJURK INSTALLATION
==================
1) Download the Djurk project into a temporary directory
   (or clone it with: git clone https://github.com/glenjarvis/djurk)

2) Copy the subfolder "djurk" to the Django directory that you configured.
   (See Prerequisite section above). This installs the Django app into your
   Django installation. Your file structure should be similar to the
   following:
   __init__.py	djurk		manage.py	settings.py	urls.py

   NOTE: Due to Django restrictions, the Django project directory (that you
         configured in the Prerequisites section above) cannot also be called
         'djurk.' The project directory should have a different name.

3) Add 'djurk' to the INSTALLED_APPS parameter in your settings file.

4) Add database tables with syncdb. Now that Django knows about the 'djurk'
   program (from step 3 above), we need to tell Django to add the appropriate
   database tables. Use the "python manage.py syncdb" command to do this:

prompt> python manage.py syncdb
Creating tables ...
Creating table djurk_hit
Creating table djurk_assignment
Creating table djurk_keyvalue
Installing custom SQL ...
Installing indexes ...
No fixtures found.

   If you don't see the message similar to "Creating table djurk_hit," then you
   either may be using the South program with Django or you may have made a
   mistake with previous instructions. If you see a message like the following,
   then proceed to step 5:

Not synced (use migrations):
 - djurk
(use ./manage.py migrate to migrate these)


5) (Optional) Migrate database:
   If you use the Django app 'South', then you will also need to migrate your
   database. It does not hurt to try this step regardless. If you see the
   message below, you can skip to step 6:

prompt> python manage.py migrate
Unknown command: 'migrate'
Type 'manage.py help' for usage

    If you have south installed, you will see output similar to the following: 

prompt> python manage.py migrate
Running migrations for djurk:
 - Migrating forwards to 0001_initial.
 > djurk:0001_initial
 - Loading initial data for djurk.
No fixtures found.

6. Enable and configure the Django Admin. By now, you should have Django, boto,
   and djurk installed. You still need to configure Django to use the admin
   (if you had not already done so previously).

   Ensure that the 'django.contrib.admin' package is enabled (not commented
   out) in the INSTALLED_APPS section of the settings.py file:

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # Uncomment the next line to enable the admin:
    'django.contrib.admin',

    Additionally, there are two sections of the urls.py file that need to
    be active (and not commented):

# Uncomment the next two lines to enable the admin:
from django.contrib import admin
admin.autodiscover()


# Uncomment the next line to enable the admin:
url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),

7. Test configuration. By now, the basic components should be installed and 
   we should be able to access the Djurk models through the Admin interface.

   Start the Django runserver:

prompt> python manage.py runserver
Validating models...

0 errors found
Django version 1.3.1, using settings 'djurk_project.settings'
Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

    Then, go to the following website:
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

    You should see a section titled 'Djurk' on this page with three options:
    * Assignments
    * HITs
    * Key-Value Pairs
