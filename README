djurk
=====
(pronounced: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jerk#Pronunciation)

The djurk project is a Django app that interfaces with and uses Amazon's
*Mechanical Turk* Service as a requester (http://mturk.com/). If you're just
starting to use Mechanical Turk, and want to try it out without getting bogged
down with the APIs, this *will be* (but isn't yet) a great place to
start.

Over time, you will grow your skills, learn about the *Boto* project
(http://code.google.com/p/boto/) which is a python interface to *Mechanical
Turk* and many more Amazon Web Services (AWS). At that point, you may say
"Wait!?!  Most of this work has been done by Amazon and the *Boto* project.
This is nothing but a set of wrappers and high level libraries that let me
access this data without having to go too deep." You would be right. Until
then, "Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain."[1]

The djurk project is currently in the pre-alpha stage. This means that,
until this note is changed, this project is not any more helpful than using
*Boto* to create a few Django models, wade through the Amazon
Documentation yourself (http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/mturk/) and get
what you need done. The goal is to present this in a Django specific way so
that you as a reader can "plug and play" without getting bogged down much with
the implementation specifics. Because documentation and clear/predictable
design are the two most important factors to make this happen and "fit in your
brain," this can always be more challenging than it seems. Until then, consider
this a pipedream (That is, bookmark it and come back later).

Why make this so public if it's little more than a few README files? Because
transparency is good. A lot can grow from a little seed like this is now.
